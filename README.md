# About Vermintide Snippets
This site hosts a collection of code examples and short snippets made for the _Warhammer: Vermintide_ game series.
Snippets made on-demand have the name(s) of the requester(s).


## How to use the snippets
To run a snippet in-game, you'll need a mod that allows executing Lua in-game:

+ [Execute Lua Ingame](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1705479264) by prop joe, also includes UI that allows you to choose snippets from a dropdown.
+ [Execute External Lua File](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1401150396) by prop joe.
+ [VermKit](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1709998063)

You can also freely use any snippet within your mods. See the [licence](./LICENCE.md) for the detailed licence information.
